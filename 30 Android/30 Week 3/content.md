# Week 3: Lists and adapters

Lists are a staple of mobile user interfaces. Many apps contain lists of items, maybe as search results, but more often than not as the main user interface! On Android, grids and lists offer varying degrees of flexibility, but they generally work the same as seen from the code.


## What to do

1. Read the [Lists and adapters](/android-reference/lists) overview

2. Practice in depth with adapters:

    - Go to [Lab 3](https://lab.cs50.io/stgm/AndroidPractice/labified/Week3/Lab/).
    - Login with your GitHub credentials, which will be used to save your lab between sessions.

3. Implement [Friendsr](/guided/friendsr).


## Reference

You'll need to read these to implement parts of your project:

- [Multiple activities](/android-reference/multiple-activities)
- [Listeners](/android-reference/listeners)
- [Persistence](/android-reference/persistence)
- [Adapters](https://github.com/Vluuks/AndroidPractice/tree/labified/Week3/Link)


## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
- level of separation between game code and user interface code


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Unit 3](/submit/unit-3).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
