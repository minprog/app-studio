# Getting started with app development

We'll now start using the book you downloaded in [preparations](/ios/introduction).
Please also download the [files](http://education-static.apple.com/app-dev-swift/v2.6/resources/student.zip) required to complete the exercises.

## Language exercises

In some respects, Swift is a bit different from most programming languages. The lessons offer to learn everything from the ground up. Feel free to skip some of the parts about the programming language, but make sure that you know *exactly* how to write correct Swift code!

1. Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds
2. Constants, variables and data types
3. Operators
4. Control flow

## Getting to know Xcode

Next up are four chapters about Xcode. You will get a lot of detail about how to use it, including the names of many of the tools that you need. You are expected to through the text and accompanying exercises.

You might want to watch the ["Introduction to Xcode"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/413/) video from Apple.

5. Xcode
6. Building, running and debugging an app
7. Documentation
8. Interface Builder basics

## Project

Now you are ready to make your first app! At the end of the chapter, you'll find a Guided Project to make a very simple app in Xcode. You can, however, choose to make your own app:

- **Guided project: Light** takes you step-by-step through making your first app. Just follow the instructions in the book! You'll probably choose this one if you haven't built applications on a platform before.

- **Unguided project: [First App](/projects/first-app)** gives you a set of requirements with which you make your app. You'll probably choose this one if you have done more than a couple of programming courses. If you don't know how to start, talk to your teacher or switch to the guided project!


## Getting credit

Make sure that you complete the language exercises and put your finished project on [Github](/ios-reference/github) *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  


This week, we will look at the following quality aspects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
