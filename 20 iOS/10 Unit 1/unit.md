# Getting started with app development

If you missed the installation instructions, there are still [there](/installation/ios)!

In the weeks ahead, you will work through the book App Development with Swift, which you can get in the Apple Book Store. Books should be available on your Mac or on your iPad. Make sure you are using the latest version of the book (Swift 4 edition). Please first download the [files](https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/swift/downloads/AppDevelopmentSwift4-Student.zip) required to complete the exercises!


## Language exercises

In some respects, Swift is a bit different from most programming languages. The lessons offer to learn everything from the ground up. Feel free to skip some of the parts about the programming language, but make sure that you know *exactly* how to write correct Swift code!

1. Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds
2. Constants, variables and data types
3. Operators
4. Control flow


## Getting to know Xcode

Next up are four chapters about Xcode. You will get a lot of detail about how to use it, including the names of many of the tools that you need. You are expected to through the text and accompanying exercises.

You might want also to watch the ["Introduction to Xcode"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/413/) video from Apple (not during lab times though!).

5. Xcode
6. Building, running and debugging an app
7. Documentation
8. Interface Builder basics


## Project

Now you are ready to make your first app! At the end of the chapter, you'll find a Guided Project to make a very simple app in Xcode.


## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Unit 1](/submit/unit-1).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
