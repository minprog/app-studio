# Madlibs

This week only had a project.

## Background

“Mad Libs” are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in. In the non-computerized version of this game, you ask someone to fill in each of the placeholders without telling them anything about the overall story. Once all placeholders are filled in, you show them the resulting silly story.

The screenshots below indicate a possible flow of the UI for an app that implements this game. It has four screens: a “welcome” screen explaining the app, then a screen where the user can chose a story, then a screen that repeatedly prompts the user to fill in placeholders. Once the user has typed in replacements for all these placeholders, the completed story is shown on the final screen. Of course you don’t need to exactly match our sample’s UI, but it may give you ideas.

## Getting Started

You don't have to do all the work, we will provide some story-files and a `Story` struct that reads a story-file and when using the provides methods will fill in the placeholders.
You can download these files [here](madlibs_ios.zip)

## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple tablet sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends


## Adding to GitHub

[Here](https://apps.mprog.nl/ios-reference/github) you'll find several instructions for adding your project's code to GitHub.


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on GitHub. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Week 4](/submit/unit-4).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
