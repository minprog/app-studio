# Native App Studio

{:toc}

## Syllabus, spring 2018

Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and optionally, how to deploy them on Google Play and
the App Store. Students practice using the platforms through a series of
programming assignments, and working towards a final project to show off
everything that has been learned. Students learn to write native apps for
Android using Studio and the Android SDK *or* to write native apps for iPhones,
iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK.

## Getting started 

You are expected to complete the provided exercises, attend most office hours, submit five fully working practice apps, as well as a final project.

- Check if your [personal timetable](https://datanose.nl/) shows App Studio.
- Come to the first session to get acquainted to the staff.
- Read the remainder of this syllabus.
- Practice object-oriented concepts in Java or Swift, and create your first app!
- When in doubt, contact the course's heads at <help@mprog.nl> or speak to an assistant.


## Prerequisites 

Programming 1 and 2, or equivalent, as decided by the course's instructor. You need to be
comfortable with memory management, runtime analysis, design patterns, databases, and basic data
structures and algorithms. You also need to have a laptop capable of running either Xcode or Android
Studio.


## Asking questions 

The course's staff consists of your instructor and many teaching assistants. You are encouraged to ask questions to the staff. Whenever you are in the lab, feel free to send a help request by using the <i class="fa fa-hand-pointer-o fa-fw"></i> menu, above.

A list of the course's staff:

- Martijn Stegeman (instructor)
- Renske Talsma (Android)
- Natasja Wezel (Android)
- Marijn Jansen (iOS)
- Emma Hokken (iOS)


## What to do

Every week, exercises and a project will be made available. Final grades are determined using the following weights:

| exercises | 10% |
| projects  | 90% |

For both exercises and projects, there are seven deadlines:

| no |     deadline |  
| -: |  ----------: |  
|  1 |  Mon   5-Nov |  
|  2 |  Fri   9-Nov |  
|  3 |  Wed  14-Nov |  
|  4 |  Wed  21-Nov |  
|  5 |  Wed  28-Nov |  
|  6 |  Wed   5-Dec | 
|  7 |  Wed  12-Dec | 

You must complete all projects to be eligible for a satisfactory grade, unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

Grading takes place portfolio-style. At the end of the course, you will have seven projects on GitHub which you will have created and refined during the weeks after first submitting. To improve and refine, you will need feedback, which you will receive from other students as well as the staff. It's your responsibility to ask for this feedback! Grading will take place after the final portfolio deadline:

| portfolio deadline |
| ------------------ |
| Mon 17-Dec 2018    |

No retakes are possible for any part of the course. You may re-take the course as a whole in a next semester.


### Exercises 

Exercises teach you the basics of programming iOS or Android. Earlier in the course, the exercises focus on learning a new programming language and reinforcing your knowledge of object-oriented design. Later, emphasis shifts to more complex parts of the programming platform, allowing you to make more interesting applications.

You can earn points for completing exercises early in the week. To earn points, complete the exercises before the deadline and demonstrate to a staff member during office hours.


### Guided projects 

Each week, you will create an app using the concepts introduced in exercises and tutorials. Points can be earned by completing the projects and demonstrating the fully functional application during office hours. In order to be eligible for points, you must have uploaded your project to GitHub and have committed and pushed any final changes before you show it to the staff.

The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  

Feedback can be obtained in class while checking off assignments. You are required to ask for feedback that you need to improve your future work!


## Office hours

Office hours are opportunities for help with projects and exercise materials alongside the course's teaching assistants. Office hours are scheduled in the [official timetable](https://datanose.nl/).


## Tutoring 

For students who avail themselves of the course's other resources but still find themselves struggling, the course offers tutoring, to the extent possible, providing opportunities for students to work with the course's staff one-on-one or in particularly small groups. To arrange, contact the course's heads.


## Books 


### Android

No books are required for students of the Android platform, but the following book may provide additional learning material: Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart and Kristin Marsicano, [*Android Programming, the Big Nerd Ranch Guide*](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/).


### iOS

Students of the iOS platform need to acquire (for free) one book in particular:

- [*App Development with Swift*](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?l=en&mt=11)

The book below may provide additional learning material:

- [*The Swift Programming Language*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)


## Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
your own work. You may read and comment upon classmates' code toward
fulfillment of projects' code reviews but only for classmates whose code is
assigned to you by the course's staff for review. You may integrate ideas and
techniques that you glean from your reviews of classmates' code and from
classmates' reviews of your code into your own work, so long as you attribute
those ideas and techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your
own code. You may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share
*code*. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in Swift, Java, or Objective-C and such languages.
If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course's
heads.


### Quoting sources 

You may turn to the web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on homework or your project. However,
failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you
do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.


### Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. In all cases we follow the directives
regarding fraud and plagiarism of the University of Amsterdam and of the Computer Science BSc
programme. Find them here in [English] and [Dutch].
