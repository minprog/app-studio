# Introduction to UIKit

## Language exercises

Feel free to skip some of the parts about the programming language, but make sure that you know *exactly* how to write correct Swift code!

1. Strings
2. Functions
3. Structures
4. Classes, Inheritance
5. Collections
6. Loops

## Project

You can choose between two projects:

- **Guided project: Apple Pie** takes you step-by-step through making an app. You'll probably choose this one if you haven't built applications on a platform before.

- **Unguided project: [Hangman](/projects/hangman)** gives you a set of requirements with which you make your app. You'll probably choose this one if you have done more than a couple of programming courses. If you don't know how to start, talk to your teacher or switch to the guided project!


## Getting credit

Make sure that you complete the exercises and put your finished project on [Github](/ios-reference/github) *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  


This week, we will look at the following quality aspects:

- (from last week) layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- (from last week) basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- (from last week) easy to use, no odds and ends
- level of separation between game code and user interface code
