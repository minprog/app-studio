# Project requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should accommodate. *Functional requirements* define the scope of the projects, and *implementation details* make sure all projects can be graded in the same way, and ensure usefulness to a broad audience.

## Mobile app

Functional requirements:

- The app should embody a solution for a clearly defined human problem and a clearly defined target audience. The solution should be reasonably original with regards to apps that are available on phones these days.

- You are invited to create an app concept of your own choosing, as long as it allows an app of sufficient complexity to be created that doesn't resemble the projects you did in earlier courses (pending approval by the course's instructor).

- The app must implement at the very least 3 separate screens/activities/controllers and be based on a combination of at least 2 online JSON APIs or interesting libraries, any of which you have not used before.

- The product should not be dependent on a user entering lots of information or be an amalgam of several loosely coupled functions.

- The product embodies good interaction design practices.

Implementation details:

- Your app's source code should be managed in an *Android Studio 3* project or and *Xcode 9* project, and your app must use Java or Swift as the source code language.

- Your app should target a recent version of the Android or iPhone SDK and need not be backwards compatible.

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime. Staff is quite good at finding "crash opportunities".

- Your app must work within the simulator; you need not test it on actual hardware.

- You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project (unless re-using a source file from another project).

## Data visualization

Functional requirements:

- The project should answer a clearly defined question, or help readers answer those questions, through a self-explanatory website. The website needs to tell a story. The story and website should be reasonably original with regards to interactive visualizations that have previously been published.

- You are invited to work on the basis of one or more data sets that you haven't used in earlier courses, as long as these allow a visualization of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval by the course's instructor).

- The final product must implement at the very least 3 linked interactive views showing different aspects of the data, as well as at least 2 other interactive components (e.g. table, dropdown, checkbox, etc.).

- At least one view should comprise a visualization that you have not implemented in earlier courses. At least one interactive component has to be connected to data (e.g., resulting in variable or dataset change).

- The final product embodies good visualization practices.

Implementation details:

- Your visualization must be published using GitHub Pages and fully works in at least one current generation browser (Chrome or Firefox are recommended).

- Your visualization must be implemented in D3 (use of additional libraries must be approved by an instructor in the first week).

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime.

- You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project (unless re-using a source file from another project).
