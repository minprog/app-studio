## Project

There's only one project this week:

- **Guided project: List** takes you step-by-step through making an app. You'll probably choose this one if you haven't built applications on a platform before.

### FAQs

#### Loading Sample ToDos
The book provides some code for loading in sample todo's at page 735, however the sampleToDos also need to be stored in the `todos` variable.

~~~swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
 
    if let savedToDos = ToDo.loadToDos() {
        todos = savedToDos
    } else {
        todos = ToDo.loadSampleToDos()
    }
}
~~~

#### DatePicker show/hide

The book provides some code for hiding the DatePicker, however, the correct IndexPath for the DatePicker is `[1,0]`.

~~~swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt
indexPath: IndexPath) {
    switch (indexPath) {
    case [1,0]:
        isEndDatePickerHidden = !isEndDatePickerHidden
 
        dueDateLabel.textColor =
        isEndDatePickerHidden ? .black : tableView.tintColor
 
        tableView.beginUpdates()
        tableView.endUpdates()
 
    default: break
    }
}

## Getting credit

Make sure that you complete the language exercises and put your finished project on Github *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  

This week, we will look at the following quality aspects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
- level of separation between model classes and user interface code
