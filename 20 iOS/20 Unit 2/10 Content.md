# Introduction to UIKit

## Language exercises

This week you will learn some essential part of the Swift language. These chapters learn you how to use object oriented programming in Swift. Feel free to skip some of the parts about the programming language, but make sure that you know *exactly* how to write correct Swift code!

1. Strings
2. Functions
3. Structures
4. Classes, Inheritance
5. Collections
6. Loops


## Getting to know UIKit

Next up are four chapters about the Interface Builder and UIKit. You will get a lot of detail about how to use it and create great user interfaces. You are expected to work through the text and accompanying exercises.

7. Introduction to UIKit
8. Displaying Data
9. Controls In Action
10. Auto Layout and Stack Views


## Project

Now you are ready to make your next app! At the end of the chapter, you'll find a Guided Project to make a simple iPad game in Xcode.

## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple tablet sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends


## Adding to GitHub

[Here](https://apps.mprog.nl/ios-reference/github) you'll find several instructions for adding your project's code to GitHub.


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on GitHub. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Unit 2](/submit/unit-2).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
