# Unit 3: Navigation and Workflows

## Language exercises

This week you will learn how to work with *optionals*. Feel free to skip some of the parts about the programming language, but make sure that you know *exactly* how to write correct Swift code!

1. Optionals
2. Typecasting and Inspection
3. Guard
4. Constants and Variable Scope
5. Enumerations

## iOS exercises

Next up are four chapters about some iOS interfaces and moving between them.

{:start="6"}
6. Segues and Navigation Controllers
7. Tab Bar Controllers
8. View Controller Life Cycle
9. Building Simple Workflows

**Tip:** Take a look at the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/) these guidelines will help you to create good iOS interfaces.


## Project

Now you are ready to make your next app! At the end of the chapter, you'll find a Guided Project. This time you'll make a Quiz app to find out something about your personality.


## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple tablet sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends


## Adding to GitHub

[Here](https://apps.mprog.nl/ios-reference/github) you'll find several instructions for adding your project's code to GitHub.


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on GitHub. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Unit 3](/submit/unit-3).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
