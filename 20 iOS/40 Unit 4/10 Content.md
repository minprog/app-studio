# Tables and Persistence


## Language exercises

Feel free to skip some of the parts about the programming language, but make sure that you know *exactly* how to write correct Swift code!

1. Protocols


## iOS exercises
<ol start=2>
    <li> App Anatomy and Life Cycle
    <li> Model View Controller
    <li> Scroll Views
    <li> Table Views
    <li> Intermediate Table Views
    <li> Saving Data
    <li> System View Controllers
    <li> Building Complex Input Screens
</ol>

## Project

There's only one project this week:

- **Guided project: List** takes you step-by-step through making an app. You'll probably choose this one if you haven't built applications on a platform before.


## Getting credit

Make sure that you complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  

This week, we will look at the following quality aspects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
- level of separation between model classes and user interface code
